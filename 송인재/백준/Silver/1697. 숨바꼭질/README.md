### 문제 설명

<p>Farmer John has been informed of the location of a fugitive cow and wants to catch her immediately. He starts at a point N (0 <= N <= 100,000) on a number line and the cow is at a point K (0 <= K <= 100,000) on the same number line. Farmer John has two modes of transportation: walking and teleporting.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Walking: FJ can move from any point X to the points X-1 or X+1 in a single minute</li>
	<li>Teleporting: FJ can move from any point X to the point 2*X in a single minute.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the cow, unaware of its pursuit, does not move at all, how long does it take for Farmer John to retrieve it?</p>
