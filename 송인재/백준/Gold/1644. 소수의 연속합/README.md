### 문제 설명

<p>Some positive integers can be represented by a sum of one or more consecutive prime numbers. How many such representations does a given positive integer have? For example, the integer 53 has two representations 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 and 53. The integer 41 has three representations 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13, 11 + 13 + 17, and 41. The integer 3 has only one representation, which is 3. The integer 20 has no such representations. Note that summands must be consecutive prime numbers, so neither 7 + 13 nor 3 + 5 + 5 + 7 is a valid representation for the integer 20.</p>

<p>Your mission is to write a program that reports the number of representations for the given positive integer.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input is a single positive integer. The integers are between 1 and 4,000,000, inclusive. </p>

### 출력 

 <p>An output line includes the number of representations for the input integer as the sum of one or more consecutive prime numbers. No other characters should be inserted in the output.</p>
