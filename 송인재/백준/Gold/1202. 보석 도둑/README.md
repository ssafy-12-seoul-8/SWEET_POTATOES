### 문제 설명

<p>The difficult economic situation in the country and reductions in government agricultural subsidy funding have caused Mirko to change his career again, this time to a thief. His first professional endeavour is a jewellery store heist. </p>

<p>The store contains N pieces of jewellery, and each piece has some mass M<sub>i</sub> and value V<sub>i</sub>. Mirko has K bags to store his loot, and each bag can hold some maximum mass C<sub>i</sub>. He plans to store all his loot in these bags, but at most one jewellery piece in each bag, in order to reduce the likelihood of damage during the escape. </p>

<p>Find the maximum total jewellery value that Mirko can “liberate”. </p>

### 입력

<p>Each of the following N lines contains a pair of numbers, M<sub>i</sub> and V<sub>i</sub> (0 ≤ M<sub>i</sub>, V<sub>i</sub> ≤ 1 000 000). </p>

<p>Each of the following K lines contains a number, C<sub>i</sub> (1 ≤ C<sub>i</sub> ≤ 100 000 000). </p>

<p>All numbers in the input are positive integers. </p>
