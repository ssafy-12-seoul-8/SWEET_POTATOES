### 문제 설명

<p>In a galaxy far, far away, the fastest method of transportation is using hypertubes. Each hypertube directly connects K stations with each other. What is the minimum number of stations that we need to pass through in order to get from station 1 to station N?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains three positive integers: N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100 000), the number of stations, K (1 ≤ K ≤ 1 000), the number of stations that any single hypertube directly interconnects, and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 1 000), the number of hypertubes.</p>

<p>Each of the following M lines contains the description of a single hypertube: K positive integers, the labels of stations connected to that hypertube.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The first and only line of output must contain the required minimum number of stations. If it isn't possible to travel from station 1 to station N, output -1.</p>
